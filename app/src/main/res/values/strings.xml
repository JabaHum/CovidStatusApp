    <string name="social_distancing">
        With social distancing, we reduce contact with each other to prevent COVID-19 spread. Conversely, if you turn out
        infected but not aware of it, so keeping away from the crowd will really help prevent the spread.\n\n
        So, if someone infected with this virus then accidentally coughs or sneezes without closing his mouth,
        then the droplet will fall on a nearby surface. When there are other people who are not infected holding
        the surface, then touches the mouth, nose or eyes without washing hands first, he has high infected risk.
        \n\nThis is what makes the transmission of this disease rise dramatically in a short time.
        Many people are not aware that they are infected, then go to various locations to meet friends
        and relatives. As a result, the spread of this virus is increasingly widespread.

    <string name="wear_mask">
        Research from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Maryland found that masks
        simple blocking 100 percent of droplets and aerosols. The Guardian writes, countries that are
        has required their citizen wearing a face mask from the beginning shows a lower mortality rate than
        countries that don\'t enforce it.\n\nHowever, the big challenge is using masks only
        will work if most people use it. Analysis from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
        about the flu estimates, if 50 percent of the population uses masks, transmission of the virus can be reduced
        by half. Meanwhile, if 80 percent of the population uses masks, the virus can be lost.\n\nBecause
        that, various regions are currently adopting laws that require the use of masks in crowded places
        such as public transportation and shops.
